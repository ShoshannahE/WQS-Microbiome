# WQS-Microbiome

These files contain the code used for analysis in the manuscript "Human Microbiome Mixture Analysis using Weighted Quantile Sum Regression." Some portions of the analysis were done in R, and some in SAS. SAS v 9.4, R v 3.6.1, and RStudio v 1.2.5001 were used for this analysis.

Files should be used in the following order.
1. HMP data pull and processing (R)
2. HMP Variable Simulation (SAS)
3. HMP WQS Analysis (R)
4. HMP comparison methods code clean (R)
5. HHEAR data processing (R)
6. HHEAR Demonstration (R)
7. HHEAR Figure 4 (SAS)
8. HHEAR Comparison Methods (Rmd)
